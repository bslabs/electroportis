 * Some further clarification from an email conversation with David Tristram:
 *
 * "The implication regarding derived works is simply that any code that you may
 * produce that includes any part of ElectroPaint does not belong to you, so you
 * can't sell it, for example, or if you do, I'd have a legal interest in the
 * proceeds. If you are interested in modifying the program's behavior or
 * appearance, I think that's okay as long as you share the modified source with
 * me. All this includes decompiled source recovered from the binaries."
